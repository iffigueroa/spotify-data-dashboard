# Spotify Data Dashboard [WIP]

My partner has been manually entering his spotify playlist data into Excel sheets so he can make plots to track which decade of music he listens to most. We realized though, that Spotify has a free API that can give us this information pretty easily. 
As a first pass I made a proof of concept to show that we could get the data he was entering manually via the API and make the same types of charts he was building in Excel. But in the next steps I'm going to see what other information we can get and if we can present it nicely/do a little analysis.
